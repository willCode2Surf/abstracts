# TALK PROMO

Really excited to share SitePro's experience using Redis TimeSeries Module in RedisConf 2021!

We will discuss the reasons it was a natural selection as we achieve
* High Availability (99.99%)
* Geographically Distributed
* Redis on Flash (RoF) over Azure NVMe
* Scaling

We will walk through the solution implemented for SitePro's hundred of thousands of real time sensors.  We will show how we implemented throughput for our analytics at scale


Thank You!
