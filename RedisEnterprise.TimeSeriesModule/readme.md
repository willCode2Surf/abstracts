# Leveraging Redis Enterprise with the TimeSeries Module to streamline real-time analytics at scale!

### ABSTRACT

In this session you'll get exposure to Redis Enterprise in Azure with a deep analysis of the TimeSeries module.  A real world scenario will be covered in how SitePro has embraced and leveraged the TimeSeries Module to replace multiple organic processes used for providing real-time and historical analytics.  SitePro leverages Redis across their entire organization as modern replacement for MQTT.  We know, love, and have used Redis for years as a key component in our industry leading real-time IoT control & monitoring platform.

Some of the things that will be covered will be how the TimeSeries Module was a natural fit for supporting data collection from hundreds of thousands of IoT sensors.  We will talk about the expectations vs the realities that we navigated so your path to production can be as successful.

Being successful with Redis TimeSeries will include understanding the features that make this offering very robust including rules, retention, data topology, labeling, and down-sampling for precision.  You will also get a quick introduction to the tooling used and different options for working with the Redis TimeSeries module from a programmatic  standpoint.

We will wrap up with a tour of some in action use for the data in the SitePro platform as well as showcasing how the same data can be leveraged in scenarios for positive impact at our company outside what the customers see.  I will also provide a Github repo that leverages some of the tooling to get started with Redis TimeSeries using NodeJS. (HelloTimeSeries)

Come learn why Redis Enterprise TimeSeries in Azure can empower real-time and historical data at scale while streamlining and simplifying operations.  Win!  Win! 

All code samples from HelloTimeSeries will be available via Github.
