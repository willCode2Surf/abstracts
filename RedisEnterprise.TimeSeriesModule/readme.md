# Leveraging Redis Enterprise with the TimeSeries Module to streamline real-time analytics at scale!

### ABSTRACT

In this session you'll get exposure to Redis Enterprise in Azure with a deep analysis of the TimeSeries module and its benefits to a real-time IoT & control platform called SitePro.  This real world scenario will be covered to demonstrate how SitePro has embraced and leveraged the TimeSeries Module to replace multiple organic processes used for providing real-time and historical analytics.  SitePro leverages Redis across their entire organization as modern replacement for MQTT.

SitePro is a mission-critical IoT platform responsible for controlling and monitoring critical infrastructure throughout the United States.  Its cutting-edge approach heavily relies on the capabilities of Redis to ensure congestion-free data flow in order to meet the real-time expectations it has created & championed in the industries it serves.

The initial interest in the Redis TimeSeries was driven by a need to continue the platform's rapid expansion and customer growth while ensuring the speed & reliability that customers expect remains at the forefront of the business objectives.  SitePro was originally created as an end-to-end system for Oil & Gas customers to reduce their environmental impact, operate safely in hazardous environments, and streamline their day-to-day activies.  At SitePro's core is the ability to provide real-time actionable data, allow users to create or fine-tune a full & granular automation process using a point-and-click setup without any programming knowledge needed (reducing the time to get up and running to minutes instead of weeks), and then overlay that with our patented intelligent remote control, which pre-processes remote commands and then calculates potential outcomes to prevent a remote user from creating an unsafe situation or causing damage to a facility or process.

Over time, other applications for the system have presented themselves in a major way.  Customer demands for the SitePro platform in many industries continue to grow. One example of this is municipalities, who have begun adopting SitePro based on the desire to modernize core practices like utility metering to better assess infrastructure needs & improve system safety while reducing their carbon footprint.  SitePro's data capture, analytics & control capabilities currently meet that need, but given the potential rapid growth, we needed a better tool in our toolbox to process that data and ensure both current and new customers continued to receive the same high-performance experience.  The data infrastructure is critical in this platform due to our "actionable data" philosophy, where we seek to provide the control & intelligence that is so important when providing a secure virtual system with direct ties & implications to the physical world.

Some of the things that will be covered will be how the TimeSeries Module was a natural fit for supporting data collection from hundreds of thousands of IoT sensors. We will talk about the expectations vs the realities that we navigated so your path to production can be as successful.

Being successful with Redis TimeSeries will include understanding the features that make this offering very robust including rules, retention, data topology, labeling, and down-sampling for precision. You will also get a quick introduction to the tooling used and different options for working with the Redis TimeSeries module from a programmatic standpoint.

We will wrap up with a tour of some in action use for the data in the SitePro platform as well as showcasing how the same data can be leveraged in scenarios for positive impact at our company outside what the customers see. I will also provide a Github repo that leverages some of the tooling to get started with Redis TimeSeries using NodeJS. (HelloTimeSeries)

Come learn why Redis Enterprise TimeSeries in Azure can empower real-time and historical data at scale while streamlining and simplifying operations. Win! Win!

All code samples from HelloTimeSeries will be available via Github.
